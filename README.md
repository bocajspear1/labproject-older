LabProject is my work in progress idea to create a virtualized lab enviroment with a web based interface.

Planned Features:

	* Virtualization of PCs, servers and entire networks using popular, modern virtualization technology
	* Multiple VM hypervisor support (with libvirt [http://libvirt.org/])
	* Support for multiple hypervisor servers
	* Support for some Cisco equipment (using GNS3 [http://www.gns3.net/])

Using:
	MongoDB [http://www.mongodb.org/]
	Libvirt [http://libvirt.org/]
	SocketStream [http://www.socketstream.org/]
